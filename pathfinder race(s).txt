companion cubes are artificial constructs, made by underground races, commonly used to guard key tunnels
they are strong and have quick mental proccessing, but only have as much knowledge as they are programed with and suffer when 
they need to rationalize choice beyond what they were programed to, a noted diviation to this race is the crystiline companion
cube race, as thier name suggests they are made out of crystal, while this makes them sturdier and expands their memory banks, 
the crystal structure is clunkier and has an adverse effect on the choice rationalization. both varients, being designed and made
underground have a sensitivity to light, which often discourages them from being sent above ground
