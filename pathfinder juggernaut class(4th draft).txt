juggernauts are profficent in simple weapons as well as light, medium and heavy armor


at first level the juggernaut gains improved unarmed strike as a bonus feat

unstoppable
the juggernaut gains DR/- equal to her level but reduces her ac by an equal amount, the juggernaut also becomes immune to fatigue, at 5th level the juggernaut also becomes immune to exhastion, at 10th level the juggernaut also becomes immune to stun, and at 15th level the juggernaut becomes immune to paralyze, the juggernaut also adds her level to her CMD vs trip attempts

at second level the juggernaut gains improved bull rush and improved overrun as bonus feats

casual break 
when performing a charge, bull rush or overrun combat manuever, the juggernaut automatically attempts to sunder all objects in her path without penalty


at 6th level the juggernaut gains improved sunder as a bonus feat

break thru
the juggernaught ignores the hardness of objects

armored juggernaut
the juggernaut is no longer impeeded by movement penalties from armor worn, at 16th level, the juggernaut adds AC from worn armor to damage from combat maneuvers or unarmed strike

toned
half the juggernaut's levels are considered monk levels for the purpose of determining base unarmed damage

power move
when the juggernaut moves in a straight line and deals some form of damage, that damage is increased by the total number of feet the juggernaut moved during that action

at 13th level the juggenaut gains run as a bonus feat

freedom of movement
the juggernaut's ability to move is unaffected by being grappled, and is un-impeeded by difficult terrain

juggernaut strength
the juggernaut adds her level to her CMB and CMD for bullrush and overruns, as well as to her unarmed strike damage, and sunder damage, also the juggernaught's stength score is considered to be twice its actual value for purpose of lifiting and carry capacity

citadel buster
even the strongest and thickest of walls cannot stop the juggernaut, walls are treated as flat terrain for juggernauts(and for others after the juggernaut passes thru them)


i'm the juggernaut!
once per day the juggernaut may call upon their inner power to unleash true distruction, the juggernaut charges in a straight line, as a full move action, each square the juggernaut passes thru suffers 20d10 damage, characters or obsticales do not impeed this move in any way, this move does not provoke attacks of opportunity, if 2 juggernauts both use "i'm the juggernaut" in opposing dirctions such that they colide, reality starts to break at the square at which they colide, the square becomes a permanent doorway to another plane(chosen at random)
