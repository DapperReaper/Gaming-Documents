gunner
at first level the sniper starts with her choice of a culvern, a rifle, or a shot gun.  Her starting weapon is battered, and only she knows how to use it properly. All other creatures treat her gun as if it had the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it does not work at all for anyone else trying to use it. This starting weapon can only be sold for scrap (it’s worth 4d10 gp when sold). the sniper also gains Gunsmithing as a bonus feat.


nerv
the sniper gains a pool of nerv points, max equal to her wisdom modifier, the sniper recovers her wisdom modifier in nerv points after 8 hours of rest, she also gains a nerv point when she reduces an enemy to 0 or fewer hit points or makes a critical hit with a ranged attack, nerv counts as grit or penache for the purpose of qualifying for feats. these nerv points may be spent in the following ways at first level

	steely aim
	by spending a nerv point, gain a +4 reflex bonus on a ranged attack roll
	
	balls of steel
	by spending a nerv point, gain a +4 competence bonus on a bluff or intimidate check
	
	death from afar
	by spending a nerv point, gain a +4 competence bonus on a perception check
	
	rapid re-caliber
	by spending 2 nerv points the sniper can remove the broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding as a standard action, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire.
	
	last shot
	by spending 7 nerv points, the sniper automatically has a normal bullet loaded in their gun, even if circumstances would normally prevent this

the sniper may not spend more nerv per round than their wisdom modifier, if the sniper ever has 0 nerv points, they gain the shaken condition, if they already have the shaken condition they gain the paralyzed condition instead, in ether case, this condition lasts until the sniper regains atleast 1 nerv point


at second level and every 3 levels thereafter, the sniper chooses a perk off the perk list, perks require nerv points to work(passive bonuses and abilities that dont require an expenditure of nerv to activate require having atleast 1 nerv point). unless explicitly stated in the perk, each perk may only be taken once
