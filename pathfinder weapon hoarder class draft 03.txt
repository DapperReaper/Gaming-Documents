magical armory
At first level, a Weapon Hoarder gains an extradimentional armory to store their weapons. The maximum number of weapons it can hold is equal to their Charisma modifier plus twice their class level. Adding a new weapon to the armory takes two rounds, though returning attuned weapons to the armory is a Swift Action that may return any number of Attuned weapons. Before being able retrieve an unattuned weapon from this armory, they must spend 30 minutes attuning it, during which they may remove the attunement of a weapon already attuned. Retrieving a weapon from this armory is a Swift Action, which may be treated as drawing the weapon for normal use or it may be moved to any point within 10 feet. Additionally, the Weapon Hoarder may retrieve a number of weapons equal to their Charisma Modifier plus one per four levels in the class they have, twice that many as the same action as a double-move or thrice as many as a full-round action.

A Weapon Hoarder may have a number of attuned weapons equal to three times their Charisma modifier plus three per four levels they have in the class floating in the air within 10 feet of them. These floating weapons do not count as attended. Up to three weapons floating in such a manner may be used to attack a single enemy as a full-attack action, with the attacks beings ranged attacks at their full BAB with a 40 foot range increment, adding their Charisma modifier to the normal weapon damage. Size and proficiency penalties apply to these attacks, as well as all qualities of the weapons. Every two levels beyond first, an additional weapon may be used in this full attack at full BAB. At 8th level, more floating weapons than the usual limit may be used in this full attack, though each beyond the normal limit takes a -4 penalty to attack rolls, stacking indefinitely. Alternatively, as a standard action, one floating weapon may be used for such an attack, with an additional weapon being able to be used with this standard action for every four levels of Weapon Hoarder.

reliquary adornments
at second level and every 2 levels thereafter the weapon hoarder selects a reliquary adornment off the following list

alacritous strike
 As a Swift Action, the Weapon Hoarder may launch a single floating attuned weapon that deals Piercing damage at great speed, attacking all creatures in a 60 ft. line at their full BAB. Every four levels, this Adornment may be selected an additional time, increasing the number of weapons able to be launched by one or increasing the range by 30 ft.


bladed bulwark
the weapon hoarder may spend an immediate action to condense a number of her floating weapons to block incoming attacks, this provides a deflection bonus against attacks equal to the number of floating weapons used, the bonus lasts till the start of her next turn and then the weapons spread back out, the weapon hoarder may use a maximum number of floating weapons equal to her charisma modifier. despite the name, weapons need not be slashing to be used in bladed bulwark


calamitous torrent
the weapon hoarder has some of her floating weapons violently spin around her, this results in each of the chosen weapons to attack all squares adjacent to her as a full round action, the weapons used immediately return to the armory afterward. the weapon hoarder may use up to her charisma modifier in floating weapons for calamitous torrent. calamitous torrent may be taken multiple times, each additional time increases the number of floating weapons that may be used by 1, or increase the radius which calamitous torrent attacks by 5ft(chosen when taken)

The Weapon Hoarder doubles the Enhancement bonus of weapons they use for attack or damage, selected at the time this Adornment is gained. Deep Weapon Understanding may be selected up to four times, twice for each of Attack and Damage. The second time the same option is picked, the effects of this Adornment for that option are applied to the floating weapons from Magical Armory.
