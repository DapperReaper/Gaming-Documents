tonberry king
the tonberry's knowledge of hatred is expansive and intricate, this earns you respect with other tonberries and you gain a +2 bonus to dimplomacy with them as well as an extravigant title(ex: golden tongued cullberry, sun soaked marberry, etc) additionally a faint astral crown sits on your head. additionally, you find new empathy with the hatred of your tonberry brothers and sisters, whenever a tonberry within 1 mile of you would take damage, you gain rancor as if you took the damage yourself, and if a tonberry dies within this radius you gain rancor equal to all the rancor they had at the time of death. rancor gained in this way is referred to as empathetic rancor, the range at which you gain empathetic rancor increases by 1 mile per additional level in tonberry king

casting progression
if the tonberry knows how to cast magic, each level of tonberry king grants additional spells per day, spells known and caster level as if she had advanced a level in that class, however no other class features are gained or progressed

intense hatred
your total hit dice and caster level are considered 1 higher for the purpose of rancor spending limits, this bonus increase by an additional +1 every 2 levels beyond

lingering hate
when you do damage by spending rancor points, the damage from the spent rancor lingers on the target and does damage again on subsiquent rounds much like bleed damage, however instead of a heal check needed to stop it, it requires a diplomacy check DC 15 to stop 

everyone's rancor
you may make a ranged attack as a full round action, if successful you expend rancor equal to your total hit dice to deal exponentially more damage, dealing an amount equal to the amount of rancor spent squared

hate worship
while this prestige class technically stops at 6, a tonberry may desire nothing more than to further her hatred, to that end, additional levels may continue to be taken on level up, however these levels only provide progression for tonberry king's range of empathetic rancor, and the bonus to intense hatred
