scion epic level rule set

start at legend 12, go thru the 3 levels of standard chargen with 300exp
each free boon dot will grant an additional boon rather than boon dot
boons that scale as epic attributes, such as arete and gease, scale as epics do(however arete does require 
additional purchases)

purchasing legend past 12 costs double exp or bonus points

willpower may be raised up to current legend instead of max of 10, however the exp cost to raise it past 11 
changes, the exp cost to raise past 11 is multiplied by 2^x where x is current willpower-10

to purchase epics past 10, must purchase the ultimate at the cost of the 11th dot, then purchase the 11th dot, 
purchases beyond 11 have normal exp cost and require mundane to be equal or higher

epics past 10 scale as normal, providing increased bonus equal to one more than the increase of the previous
epic(epic 2 is 2 auto sucesses, epic 3 is 4, 2 more(2+2), epic 4 for is 7, 3 more(4+3), epic 5 is 11, 4 more(7+4) etc)

every 10 legend past 12 the scion gets a free epic attribute dot to assign where they want

abilities cap at legend instead of 5

every 20 legend past 12, the scion gains 5 dots worth of birthrights, these dots may be added to existing 
birthrights or take the form of new birthrights, if adding to existing birthrights, any single birthright may not go 
above 5, however all birthrights combined has no cap

at legend 100 the scion may purchase legendary attributes, legendary attributes are much like their epic 
counterparts, however legendary attribute bonuses scale as 2n^n where n is the current level of legendary 
attribute, so 1 dot of a legendary attribute, the benefit would be 2*(1^1)= 2, 2 legendary dots would result in
2*(2^2)=8, 3 legendary dots would be 2*(3^3)=18, 4 legendary dots would be 2*(4^4)=32, etc
legendary attribute dots cost 15 exp for a new dot or current rating x20 for raising an existing dot
legendary attribute bonuses stack with epic attibute bonuses

at legend 13 the scion gets a second legend pool, the max value of which is equal to legend rating^3, however
this secondary legend pool is 10 times as likely to fate bind when spending legend from it

every legend past 15 the scion gains 1 free mundane attribute dot to distribute where they want

every legend past 12 the scion gains 1 additional -0 health 

every 5 legend past 12 the scion gains 1 dot of appearance and 1 dot of epic appearance, the scion chooses whether 
these dots are beautiful or gruesome
